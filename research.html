<p></i> <br> <i>Abstract</i>:From the onset of the first confirmed case
of COVID-19 in January 2020 to Election Day in November, the United
States experienced over 9,400,000 cases and 232,000 deaths. This crisis
largely defined the campaign between former Vice President Joe Biden and
President Donald Trump, centering on the Trump administration′s efforts
in mitigating the number of cases and deaths. While conventional wisdom
suggested that Trump and his party would lose support due to the
severity of COVID-19 across the country, such an effect is hotly debated
empirically and theoretically. In this research, we evaluate the extent
to which the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic influenced support for
President Trump in the 2020 election. Across differing modeling
strategies and a variety of data sources, we find evidence that
President Trump gained support in counties with higher COVID-19 deaths.
We provide an explanation for this finding by showing that voters
concerned about the economic impacts of pandemic-related restrictions on
activity were more likely to support Trump and that local COVID-19
severity was predictive of these economic concerns. While COVID-19
likely contributed to Trump’s loss in 2020, our analysis demonstrates
that he gained support among voters in localities worst affected by the
pandemic.</p>

<p></i> <br> <i>Abstract</i>: Recent work on American presidential
election cycles posits that voters engage in anticipatory balancing,
with voters being more likely to vote against a legislative candidate if
they believe the candidate’s party will win the presidency. This theory
predicts split-ticket voting on the basis that voters prefer divided
government to moderate collective policy outcomes by forcing agreement
among institutions controlled by opposing parties. We test this theory
within the context of the 2021 Georgia U.S. Senate runoffs, which solely
determined whether Democrats would have unified control of the federal
government by determining majority control of the Senate. This context
provides a crucial test of the theory by providing an environment of
perfect information in which partisan control of the presidency and the
House of Representatives is already determined and not conditional on
standing election outcomes across states. Leveraging an original survey
of Georgia voters, we find no evidence of balancing within the general
electorate and among partisans across differing model specifications. We
confirm this lack of balancing in qualitative content analysis of voter
electoral runoff intentions. We reconcile this lack of evidence for
balancing to original analysis showing the unprecedented partisan nature
of contemporary Senate elections since direct-election began in
1914.</p>

<p></i> <br> <i>Abstract</i>: This paper examines the effects of Chile’s
2015 electoral reform, which increased the magnitude of districts in
Chile’s lower legislative chamber from two to between three and eight.
This increase in district magnitude allows for a convenient “natural
experiment”: post-reform voters should strategically vote at lower
levels than pre-reform voters. I find strong evidence that voters have
responded to Chile’s electoral reform by engaging in less party-level
strategic voting. However, I surprisingly find no evidence that the
reform has decreased strategic voting for Chile’s pre-electoral pacts.
This study demonstrates that Chile’s electoral reform is already
affecting voter behavior and is doing so in line with theoretical
expectations.</p>

<p><i>Abstract</i>: While scholars have found that Trump was able to
capitalize on the racial attitudes of white voters, it is less clear how
these racial attitudes influenced vote-choice across partisan and
ideological cleavages in the electorate. It is also unclear whether
racial attitudes affected voting at the congressional level or electoral
outcomes at the aggregate level. Using a novel measure of racial
attitudes at the subnational level and survey data, we make three clear
findings: (1) Trump and Republican congressional candidates benefited
from conservative racial attitudes both at the aggregate level and among
white voters, (2) this electoral benefit for Republicans persisted
during the 2018 midterm elections, and (3) the effect of attitudes on
vote-choice did not significantly vary across partisan and ideological
cleavages in the white electorate. Our findings suggest that, even
during the era of highly nationalized and partisan elections, racial
attitudes are still a mechanism by which Republicans can win significant
electoral support among Democrats and relatively liberal voters in the
white electorate. These findings have implications for the growing
salience of race in the Republican electoral coalition.</p>

<p><i>Abstract</i>: This study examines the effect of electoral system
variation in U.S. state legislative elections on candidate ideological
dispersion. Previous work suggests that, under certain conditions,
greater district magnitude has a centrifugal polarizing effect on
candidate ideology. Cross-national investigations of this theory by
Ezrow (2008) and Dow (2001, 2011) have produced conflicting results.
Building on this body of research, this paper leverages electoral system
variation in U.S. state legislative elections to evaluate whether
district-level electoral system variation influences candidate ideology.
We find strong evidence for a polarizing effect of district magnitude on
candidate ideology, even under plurality voting. This paper has
significant implications for our understanding of candidate ideological
positioning in sub-national contexts as well of how electoral systems
affect the quality of representation voters receive from
legislators.</p>

<p><i>Abstract</i>: Strategic voting occurs when voters make vote
choices using their ex ante expectations about the results of an
election in addition to their sincere candidate preferences. While there
is ample theoretical reason to believe strategic voting should occur
under certain electoral conditions and institutional arrangements, the
evidence for it in the literature has been mixed. I theorise that the
polarisation of the two main British political parties and the highly
publicised predictions of defeat for Britain’s primary national third
party, the Liberal Democrats, make the 2015 UK election an ideal case
for studying strategic voting. I adapt established methods of
identifying strategic voting to this election and find evidence that
Liberal Democrat voters in the UK voted strategically for Labour and
Conservative candidates to maximise their odds of affecting the
electoral outcome in their constituency.</p>

<p><i>Abstract</i>: Despite the longstanding underrepresentation of
blacks in Congress, political science research has not settled on the
cause. While there is increasing evidence that racial attitudes affect
vote choice in today’s congressional elections, how this effect
interacts with the race of the candidates is unknown. This study
addresses this debate by analyzing novel survey, census, and candidate
data from the Obama era of congressional elections (2010-2016) in order
to test whether racially prejudiced attitudes held by whites decrease
their likelihood of supporting black Democratic candidates and
Democratic candidates as a whole. In line with theoretical predictions,
this paper finds that Democratic House candidates are less likely to
receive votes among white voters with strong racial resentment towards
blacks, and black Democratic candidates fare even worse. These findings
provide an explanation for black legislative underrepresentation and
contribute to theories of partisan racial realignment.</p>

<p></i> <br> <i>Abstract</i>: While the use of racial appeals by the
2016 Trump campaign is indisputable, researchers are actively debating
their precise role in influencing voter behavior in the election. We
seek to expand upon existing research which finds that racial animus
electorally benefited the Trump campaign. We examine to what extent
those benefits redounded to GOP candidates down-ballot and whether
racial animus distorted ideological proximity voting in the 2016
election. We find that racial animus among voters helped Republicans at
multiple ballot levels and that higher levels of racial animus distorted
correct proximity voting among voters ideologically closest to the
Democratic candidate. Our findings suggest that high salience campaign
appeals on race at the presidential level can influence elections for
the House and Senate. We also provide evidence that the process of
racial partisan realignment is incomplete, as some white voters still
vote incongruously with their ideology due to racial animus.</p>

beginning in 2012. In particular we focus on general election contests
between candidates of the same party that were not possible under the
previous primary system, but have occurred with some regularity with the

<i>Abstract</i>: A large body of research shows that voters’ racial attitudes, the race of candidates, and the race of party leaders have a significant effect on vote choice in elections in the United States. However, there is far less research on whether similar effects exist in Canadian national elections. Using data from the recently released 2019 Canadian Election Study, I examine the effect of racial attitudes on the electoral performance of the New Democratic Party (NDP). The NDP is led by Jagmeet Singh, the first nonwhite leader of a nationally competitive Canadian political party. My preliminary findings show that Canadian voters with racially conservative attitudes were less likely to support NDP candidates in the 2019 election, even when accounting for voters’ partisanship and ideology. These results suggest that racial attitudes are a salient feature in Canadian elections, and that national parties may face a real electoral penalty by selecting non-white party leaders.

<i>Abstract</i>: While scholarly attention has focused on the role racial resentment plays in shaping political preferences, relatively little is known how racial resentment influences the propensity of citizens to participate in politics. In this paper, we present a model positing that racial resentment motivates the degree to which white Americans participate in the political process. Using a novel measure of racial resentment at the subnational level and survey data, we make three clear findings: (1) racial resentment is associated with higher observed turnout at the congressional district and state level, (2) latent racial resentment also motivates the propensity of individual white voters to turnout to vote, and (3) latent racial resentment also motivates more sophisticated forms of political participation, such as campaign involvement. By contrast, we find no evidence that racial resentment motivates non-white Americans to participate in democratic politics. These findings compliment standing work finding that racial resentment serves as a powerful predictor of electoral choice among whites, to the benefit of Republican candidates. These findings have implications for the potency of racial resentment as a motivating factor in the electoral calculus of white Americans.
