Welcome to my website! I am an Equity Research Postdoctoral Scholar at <a href="https://www.blumcenter.ucsb.edu/"> UC Santa Barbara's Blum Center on Poverty, Inequality, and Democracy</a>. I received my PhD from the <a href="https://ps.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a> in June 2020. Prior to arriving at UCSB, I served as a Lecturer of Political Science at UC Davis.

My research agenda examines how racial attitudes and the design of electoral institutions can undermine representation in the US and other developed democracies. I have published several papers analyzing how racial attitudes affect voter behavior and legislative representation, particularly in recent U.S. elections. In addition, I also have a series of publications that examine the effects of electoral systems on voter representation and efficacy in the US, the UK, and Chile.  To learn more about my past and current projects, please visit the <a href="https://www.isaacdhale.com/research.html">Research</a> and <a href="https://www.isaacdhale.com/cv.html">CV</a> sections of this website. You can find links to my public scholarship, including invited blog posts, news coverage of my research, and interviews I have done for podcasts/television/newspapers on the <a href="https://www.isaacdhale.com/media.html">Public Scholarship</a> page.
 
In addition to my research, I have also served as a Lecturer and Associate Instructor in the UC Davis Department of Political Science. In this capacity, I developed and implemented curricula suitable for a diverse group of undergraduate students. To access the syllabi and other materials for each class I that have instructed, please visit the <a href= "https://www.isaacdhale.com/teaching.html">Teaching</a> page.
