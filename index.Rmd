Welcome to my website! I am an Equity Research Postdoctoral Scholar at <a href="https://www.blumcenter.ucsb.edu/"> UC Santa Barbara's Blum Center on Poverty, Inequality, and Democracy</a>. I received my PhD from the <a href="https://ps.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a> in June 2020. Prior to arriving at UCSB, I served as a Lecturer of Political Science at UC Davis.

My research agenda focuses broadly on electoral systems, legislative representation, and the intersection of race & American politics. My graduate work, advised by Professors Matthew S. Shugart and James F. Adams, focused on how electoral systems shape electoral outcomes and candidate behavior in the US, the UK, and Chile. In addition, I have authored several papers analyzing how racial attitudes affect voter behavior and legislative representation, particularly in recent U.S. elections. To learn more about my past and current projects, please visit the <a href="https://www.isaacdhale.com/research.html">Research</a> and <a href="https://www.isaacdhale.com/cv.html">CV</a> sections of this website. You can find links to my public scholarship, including invited blog posts, news coverage of my research, and interviews I have done for podcasts/television/newspapers on the <a href="https://www.isaacdhale.com/media.html">Public Scholarship</a> page.
 
In addition to my research, I have also served as a Lecturer and Associate Instructor in the UC Davis Department of Political Science. In this capacity, I developed and implemented curricula suitable for a diverse group of undergraduate students. To access the syllabi and other materials for each class I that have instructed, please visit the <a href= "https://www.isaacdhale.com/teaching.html">Teaching</a> page.
