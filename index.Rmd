Welcome to my websiste! I received my PhD from the <a href="https://ps.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a> in June 2020. Currently, I am a Lecturer of Political Science at UC Davis.

My research agenda focuses broadly on electoral systems, legislative representation, and the intersection of race & American politics. My graduate work, advised by Professors Matthew S. Shugart and James F. Adams, focused on how electoral systems shape electoral outcomes and candidate behavior in the US, the UK, and Chile. In addition, I am also involved in projects analyzing how racial attitudes affect voter behavior and legislative representation, particularly in recent U.S. elections. To learn more about my past and current projects, please visit the <a href="https://isaacdhale.github.io/personal_site/research.html">Research</a> and <a href="https://isaacdhale.github.io/personal_site/cv.html">CV</a> tabs of this website.
 
In addition to my research, I have also served as a Lecturer and Associate Instructor in the UC Davis Department of Political Science. In this capacity, it is my task to develop and implement curricula suitable for a diverse group of undergraduate students. To access the syllabi for each class I that have instructed, please visit the <a href= "https://isaacdhale.github.io/personal_site/teaching.html">Teaching</a> tab.
